It looks so cool !

So here we go, this code does following in addition to previous work on rating

1.  Replace any bad comment word with *** , list of  bad word I gave in the array , we can increase the lists

$originals = array("douche","fuck","damn","fucking","darn","hate");
$replacements = array("***","***","***");
$comment = str_ireplace($originals,$replacements,$comment);

2. Comment is getting saved and when the same user is logged in , he/she can see his/her comments and make changes

3. It  uses following function to avoid security risk

$comment = filter_var($str, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
trim($comment);
$comment = stripslashes($comment);
$comment = htmlspecialchars($comment);
